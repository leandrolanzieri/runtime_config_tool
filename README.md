# [POC] Runtime configuration tool
This is still a work in progress.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` that are only used in electron on the backend when the application is built by the packager. Please use `npm` as dependencies manager.

Based on the [Angular Electron project] (https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron).

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start  


The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs at (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.  
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.  
You can disable "Developer Tools" by commenting `win.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.ts`.
